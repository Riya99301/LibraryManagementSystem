- **Return Book**: Returns a book and increases its quantity in the library.
- **Sort Books**: Sorts the books alphabetically by title.
- **Authentication**: A basic authentication system requiring a username and password for administrative tasks.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java**: Main programming language used to implement the system.
- **Scanner**: For handling user input through the console.
- **Collections**: Used to store and manage book records.

## How to Run:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage the books in the library.

## Future Enhancements:
- Implementing database support for persistent storage.
- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Adding features like user roles (admin, librarian, student) with different permissions.
